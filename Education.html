    <h4>5 PILLARS OF ISLAM</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Shahadah The First Pillar of Islam</li>
        <li>SALAh</li>
        <li>ZAKAT</li>
        <li>Fasting</li>
        <li>HAJJ</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1.FAITH (Shahadah The First Pillar of Islam)</h4>
    <p>The shahada stands as the foremost and pivotal pillar of Islam. It represents the core belief and a sincere
        declaration of faith and trust in which a person acknowledges and affirms that:

        لَا اِلٰہ اَلَّا اللہُ مُحَمَّدُ رَّسُول اللہ

        The above written is the representation of shahada in Arabic which states:

        “There is no God except Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ and the Beloved Last Prophet Muhammad صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہِ
        وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ is the Messenger of Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.”

        The meaning of Shahada in Islam is encapsulated in its two distinct parts. The first part means that “none is
        worthy to be worshipped but Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ alone, and that Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ has neither partner nor
        son”. The second part of the belief asserts that “محمد صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ is the
        last Messenger of Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.”

        Muslims believe in the finality of Prophethood with the acceptance of Prophet Muhammad صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی
        عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ as the "Last of all Prophets." This belief signifies that His Prophethood confirms
        and completes all the messages revealed to earlier Prophets, starting from Prophet Adam عَلَیْہِ السَّلَام.</p>
    <h4>2.SALAH(A Daily Prayer)</h4>
    <p>The second pillar of Islam, the daily 5 prayers, symbolize a believer's submission to Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ and
        serve as a public display of their commitment to Islam. This pillar holds immense significance, ranking after
        the Shahada. It is through this regular practice that Muslims acknowledge their dependence on Allah and their
        need for spiritual nourishment, seeking guidance, and seeking forgiveness.
    </p>
    <h4>First Question in Afterlife</h4>
    <p>Although Salah is the second pillar of Islam but the beloved and blessed Prophet صَلَّى الـلّٰـهُ عَلَيْهِ
        وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم said, “On the Day of Judgement, the very first question that will be asked to man out of his
        deeds will be about Salah; if his Salah is correct, he will succeed but if it is incomplete, he will be
        disgraced and will suffer loss.” (Al-Mu’jam-ulAwsat-lit-Tabrani, pp. 32, vol. 3, Hadis 3782)</p>
    <h4>3.Zakat – The Third Pillar of Islam</h4>
    <p>Zakat, stands as the third pillar of Islam and is obligatory for every financially capable Muslim whose income
        meets or exceeds the prescribed amount by Sharia (Nisaab), in addition to their essential expenses.

        Zakat is a fundamental pillar of Islam, representing the act of giving a portion of one's wealth to those in
        need, aiming to promote social justice and compassion within the community. It serves as both a religious duty
        and a means of fostering solidarity among believers.</p>
<h4>4.Fasting - The Fourth Pillar of Islam</h4>
<p>The fourth pillar of Islam is Fasting, which requires Muslims to fast during the sacred month of Ramadan. Ramadan fasting rules are that every pubescent Muslim is obligated to observe fasting, refraining from food, drink, and sexual activity throughout the fasting hours.

    The purpose of Ramadan fasting in Islam is to enhance one's piety and provides an opportunity to empathize with the hunger and hardship experienced by the less fortunate. It instills discipline, strengthens one's devotion and religious commitment, fosters a deeper awareness of God and His favors, and serves as a method for seeking forgiveness.
    
    Additionally, sawm serves as a beneficial exercise for the human body, as it allows us to cleanse our digestive system from the indulgence in unnecessary foods throughout the year. During the holy month of Ramadan, global markets often lower prices to support Muslims in their observance.</p>
<h4>5.What Is Hajj in Islam?</h4>
<p>Hajj, the fifth pillar of Islam, is a pilgrimage undertaken to the holy city of Makkah during the month of Zul-Ḥijjah. The date of hajj in Islamic calendar begins on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah and lasts until the 13th of Dhul Hijjah. This profound journey, marked by its challenges, is an obligatory endeavour for financially and physically capable Muslims.

    It involves completing the designated rituals of Hajj in honor of Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ. Those who successfully accomplish this voyage earn the esteemed title of Ḥaji. Every year, millions of Muslims gathered in Makkah for Hajj festival – the sacred Muslim Pilgrimage annually, underscoring the unity of humanity and their equal devotion before Allah عَزَّوَجَلَّ.</p>
