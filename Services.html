    <h3><u>2.MSAJID AND MADARID BY</u></h3>
    <P>Allama Maulana Muhammad Ilyas Attar Qadri Razawi
        The aim of this department is to acquire plots for Masajid and Madaris at various places according to Islami
        guidelines and the laws of the countries, and cooperate in their construction with the help of locals. By the
        grace of Allah Almighty, this department has also purchased worshipping sites of non-Muslims and even cinemas,
        and has turned them into Masajid.
        For over two decades, Khuddam-ul-Masajid Wal Madaris has been involved in the construction of thousands of
        mosques globally, uniting Muslims across the globe to worship Allah Almighty. We are on a mission to construct
        sacred places where Muslims can gather, pray, and find solace.
